This is Data Tron 8.0.

.SYNOPSIS
This script is used to install Relativity Data Grid to a server or "node", refered to as a "install run". 

.DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this script is to install Relativity Data Grid to a single server.

The script relies on a file in the script directory called Config.psd1

This configuration file can be created by running this script with  only the -config switch and no other arguements.

To install Relativity Data Grid to a server you must specify the drive letter that will host the service and the machine name.

.NOTES

The script can also be used to create a config file for an install run.

The script must reside in the root folder DataTron.

The DataTron folder must contain the RelativityDataGrid Folder.

The RelativityDataGrid folder must contain a jdk version 8 installer and the certificate which will be used by shield for authentication.

A Config.psd1 file must be generated before doing an install run of the script.

.PARAMETER DriveLetter
The drive letter to host the Relativity Data Grid folder and from which the Elasticsearch service will run.  This must be a single character.  Don't use a colon.

This is a mandatory parameter during a installation run.

.PARAMETER MachineName
The name of the server where Relativity Data Grid will be installed.

.PARAMETER IsMaster
Use this parameter to create a master node for the production cluster.

.PARAMETER IsClient
Use this parameter to create a client node for the production cluster.

.PARAMETER IsData
Use this parameter to create a data node for the production cluster.

.PARAMETER IsMonitor
Use this parameter to create a monitoring node for the monitoring cluster.

.PARAMETER dontCopyFolders
Specify this switch to skip copying of the Relativity Data Grid folder.

.PARAMETER dontInstalljava
Spdcify this switch to skip java installation.

.PARAMETER Config
Use this switch to create a config file for an install run.

.EXAMPLE
.\DataTron\Run-DataTron6.0.ps1 -Config

This will create a Config.psd1 file in the directory for and install run.
This is a switch and cannot be run with any other parameters.

.EXAMPLE
.\Run-DataTron3.0.ps1 -driveLetter c -machineName someserver -IsMaster $true

Once a Config.psd1 file is created the script can be used to do an install run.
This example installs RelativityDataGrid to the c drive of someserver.


.EXAMPLE
.\DataTron\Run-DataTron3.0.ps1 -driveLetter c -machineName someserver -IsMaster $true -dontCopyfolders

Does an install run but does not copy the RelativityDataGrid folder.

.EXAMPLE
.\DataTron\Run-DataTron3.0.ps1 -driveLetter c -machineName someserver -IsMaster $true -dontInstallJava

Does an install run but does not install Java.

.EXAMPLE
.\DataTron\Run-DataTron3.0.ps1 -driveLetter c -machineName someserver -IsMaster $true -dontInstallJava -dontCopyfolders

Does an install run but does not install Java and does not copy the installation folders.
